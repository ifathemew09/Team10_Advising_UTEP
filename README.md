# Team10_Advising_UTEP
CS 4342 Database Management Project


We will develop an Advising system for the Computer Science Department to aid in managing advising from the Admin/advisor perspective. The system will authenticate each user, such as the Student, Advisor, and Admin. The system will store advising documents the student has provided, such as: Degree Plans, The Change of Major/Minor Form (if needed), Flowchart, Academic Advising Form, etc. The system will check a student's classification before scheduling a meeting with the advisor. The system shall keep track of probationary status and any change of advisors.  


The admin will manage the creation and deletion of Advisors and Students in the system. The admin will have a unique Employee Number, a name (first name, middle name, and last name). The admin will have access to remove holds for a student after receiving confirmation from the advisor. The admin will provide the advisor a list of students to be advised. The admin can leave notes on any student in the Computer Science department.


The advisor will be able to view the students schedule and uploaded forms from the student’s data, such as: transfer documents from classes, documents about changes in students grades, documents on graduation, and the advising form. The advisor will have access to edit the advising form. The advisor will have a list of students they will advise and access the student’s academic profile to make comments about the student. The advisor also will fill out their students advising form and can make notes on students in their list.


The student will be authenticated in order to access the system. The student will have a unique Student ID. They will have a personal profile on the system. The student will be allowed to request advising, cancel an appointment, contact the advisor, and submit forms. The system will have a folder containing all the documents that belong to that specific student. The student will be able to fill out their availability schedule and request a slot for advising.


The admin will have the responsibility of creating and removing advisors and students from the system, if needed.
